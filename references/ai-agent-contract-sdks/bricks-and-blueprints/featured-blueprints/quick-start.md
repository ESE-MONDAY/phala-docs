**Important**

This guide references the `mumbai` testnet chain.&#x20;

The`mumbai` testnet is [deprecated since 2024/04/08](https://polygon.technology/blog/introducing-the-amoy-testnet-for-polygon-pos), meaning the steps to deploy to a testnet will no longer work out of the box.

You can opt to use the [`amoy`](https://polygon.technology/blog/introducing-the-amoy-testnet-for-polygon-pos) testnet or any other EVM testnet instead..

To kickstart your journey with the Phat Contract Starter Kit, install the `@phala/fn` CLI tool.&#x20;

You can do this using your node package manager (`npm`) or use node package execute (`npx`). For the purpose of this tutorial, we will be using `npx`.

Once you have the CLI tool installed, you can create your first Phala Oracle template with the following command...

:octagonal\_sign: **Not so fast!** What is it exactly that we are building? :octagonal\_sign:

> **What are we building?**
>
> The artifact we are compiling is a JavaScript file, serving as the Phat Contract Oracle's tailored logic. This script is designed to respond to requests initiated from the Consumer Contract. The diagram provided above offers a visual representation of this request-response interaction.
>
> **Why is it important?**
>
> In the context of the off-chain environment, on-chain Smart Contracts are inherently limited. Their functionality is confined to the information available to them within the on-chain ecosystem. This limitation underscores the critical need for a secure off-chain oracle, such as the Phat Contract. This oracle is capable of fetching and transforming data, thereby enhancing the intelligence and awareness of Smart Contracts about on-chain activities. This is a pivotal step towards bridging the gap between the on-chain and off-chain worlds, making Smart Contracts not just smart, but also informed.

Let's continue by initializing a new project with `@phala/fn`.

```sh
npx @phala/fn@latest init example
? Please select one of the templates for your "example" project: 
‚ùØ phat-contract-starter-kit: Send data from any API to your smart contract with Javascript. 
  lensapi-oracle-consumer-contract: Send data from Lens API to your smart contract to empower your Web3 Social dApp. 
  vrf-oracle: TEE-guarded Verifiable Random Function template to bring randomness to your smart contract. 
  airstack-phat-contract: Request an account‚Äôs data from Airstack‚Äôs API to compute trust score and send to your Web3 dApp on-chain. 
  thegraph-phat-contract: Connect your subgraphs from The Graph to your on-chain dApps via Phat Contract.  
```

After creating a Phala Oracle template, `cd` into the new project and install the package dependencies. You can do this with the following command:

```sh
npm install
```

Now, build the default Phala Oracle function with this command:

```sh
npx @phala/fn build
```

To simulate the expected result locally, run the Phala Oracle function now with this command.

> Go to [https://playground.ethers.org](https://playground.ethers.org) to `decode` and `encode` the hexstring you want to pass into your Phat Contract `main` function.
>
> In this example, the hexstring  `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000004000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000043078303100000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000` represents types `uint id` and `string reqData`

> * `[ BigNumber { value: "1" }, "0x01", id: BigNumber { value: "1" }, reqData: "0x01" ]`
>
> You can easily validate this by encoding the types and data with the `utils.defaultAbiCoder.encode()` function like below.

```

> **What are the ingredients for the yarn run-function command?**
>
> Our Phat Contract script, now fully constructed, is ready for a trial run. This simulation mirrors the live script's operation when deployed on the Phala Network.
>
> The command's first parameter is a `HexString`, representing a tuple of types `[uintCoder, bytesCoder]`. This serves as the entry function. The second parameter is a `string`, embodying the configurable secrets fed into the main function.
>
> The `Coders.decode` function deciphers these parameters, yielding the decoded `requestId` and `encodedReqStr`. These decoded elements then become the raw material for the rest of the custom logic within the script.
>
> ```typescript
> export default function main(request: HexString, settings: string): HexString {
>   console.log(`handle req: ${request}`);
>   let requestId, encodedReqStr;
>   try {
>     [requestId, encodedReqStr] = decodeRequest(decodeRequestAbiParams, request);
>   } catch (error) {
>     console.info("Malformed request received");
>   }
>   // ...
> }

Finally, run the local end-to-end tests with this command. Here we will simulate locally the interaction between the Phat Contract and the Consumer Contract with hardhat.

```sh
npm run localhost-test
```
