# ETHGlobal Hackathon Guide

## Phala Hackathon Guide at ETHGlobal Singapore

Welcome to the Phala Hackathon Guide! This guide will provide you with all the necessary information to get started building on our platform. Whether you're a seasoned developer or new to the ecosystem, this guide will help you navigate through the essential steps and resources.

### Introduction

The Phala Hackathon Guide will take you through the steps to build and deploy AI Agent Contracts. In this guide we will guide you through acquiring an OpenAI API Key through [RedPill](https://red-pill.ai/), set up an Agent Contract template to deploy and interact with, and learn a **new paradigm in transacting onchain** Agent Contract Template + Viem SDK where you can derive an ECDSA account within a TEE and utilize the account to sign/verify messages and transact on any EVM chain. These guides will provide the basic tools to start building on Phala Network.

**Note**: You can use any LLM API for your Agent Contract. You are not limited to only use RedPill. Also, the WapoJS Engine .

### Prizes

We have exciting prizes for the top project:

1. 1st Place: $3,000 + Ledger Nano X
2. 2nd Place: $1,500 + TEE Swag
3. 3rd Place: $500 + TEE Swag

**Bonus Bounty**: Reach the ETHGlobal finals, and youâ€™ll snag another Ledger Nano X on us!

How to qualify for as a top project?

* (Strong Consideration) Integrate [Agent Contract with the Viem SDK](https://github.com/Phala-Network/ai-agent-contract-viem) to interact on-chain with any EVM Chain or other sponsor projects at ETHGlobal to create a unique product.
* (Strong Consideration) Build an AI x Web3 product with [RedPill Agent Contract Template](https://github.com/Phala-Network/ai-agent-template-redpill) or any other AI related templates we support located in our [docs](https://docs.phala.network/ai-agent-contract/getting-started/ai-agent-contract-templates)
* Deploy any custom Agent Contract that can be interacted with via HTTP requests

Each winner will get access to a Tier 2 Swag Bag provided by the Phala Team

### Important Dates

### Getting Started

To get started with Phala Network, follow these steps:

1. Determine what type of Agent Template build on:

* **Take the RedPill and access top AI LLMs**: Get an API Key on [RedPill](https://red-pill.ai/). (This requires a code to get access. Reach out to the Phala Team to get access. In the meantime, use the free developer API key that is rate limited.)
* **Try a New Paradigm in Transacting Onchain**: Build on the [viem Agent Contract Template](https://github.com/Phala-Network/ai-agent-contract-viem) where you can derive an account within a TEE and utilize the account to transact on any EVM chain.

2. **Explore Documentation**: Familiarize yourself with our [Developer Documentation](https://docs.phala.network/).
3. **Join the Community**: Connect with other developers on our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/phala-network).

### Get API Key on RedPill

If you want to use the global hackathon RedPill API key, here are the details:

* API Endpoint URL: [https://api.red-pill.ai/](https://api.red-pill.ai/)
* API Key: `sk-qVBlJkO3e99t81623PsB0zHookSQJxU360gDMooLenN01gv2`

* Supported Models: [https://docs.red-pill.ai/get-started/list-models](https://docs.red-pill.ai/get-started/list-models)

Before you start building, you'll need to set up your development environment. Here are the prerequisites:

1. **Node.js**: Install the latest version of Node.js from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
2. **Code Editor**: Any code editor will work. We recommend using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

#### Test RedPill API

```
curl https://api.red-pill.ai/v1/chat/completions
-H "Content-Type: application/json"
-H "Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_REDPILL_API_KEY>"
-d '{ "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "messages": [ { "role": "user", "content": "Hello world!" } ], "temperature": 1 }'
```
