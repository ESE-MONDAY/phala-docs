# Use Cases

Phat Contract is designed for the following use cases, and remember: _all these features come with Phalaâ€™s trustless and decentralized infrastructure_.

## Low-latency <a href="#low-latency" id="low-latency"></a>

Services like GameFi or Metaverse backends

* Run Decentraland game server in Phala workers with little changes ([catalyst](https://github.com/Phala-Network/catalyst/tree/sgx-shielded) and [catalyst-owner](https://github.com/Phala-Network/catalyst-owner/tree/sgx-shielded))

## Compute-intensive <a href="#compute-intensive" id="compute-intensive"></a>

Applications like NFT rendering, machine learning, and big data analytics

* See [demo video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=corp9wMlkfI\&t=1s) of running unmodified [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) in Phala workers, with [source code](https://github.com/Phala-Network/blender-contract)

## Privacy-preserving <a href="#privacy-preserving" id="privacy-preserving"></a>

Scenarios like a decentralized exchange and others where privacy matters

* Check our design and implementation of [secret NFT](https://github.com/tenheadedlion/phat-nft) with Phat Contract&#x20;

## Composable <a href="#composable" id="composable"></a>

Applications including Oracle, bots, and other applications involving one or more Web2/Web3 services

* See [demo video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THeM8E-3lec) of using Phat Contract to read other chains' states through indexing services
* Follow our [Oracle workshop](https://github.com/Phala-Network/phat-offchain-rollup/tree/sub0-workshop/phat) and build the full-functional Oracle for any EVM-compatible chains ([Demo video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Hg9HFEBbCiXGiyQZPKPd1Zs1BiJtP7kg/view) for BSC)
