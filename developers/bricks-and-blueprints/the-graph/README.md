# ðŸ“ˆ The Graph

The Graph template enables you to connect to subgraph endpoints for data and utilize the data to calculate a trust score and send to a Web3 dApp on an EVM chain.

## Requirements Before Deployment

There are a couple steps to complete before deploying The Graph Template.

* Create a [Phat Contract 2.0 Profile](../create-a-phat-contract-profile.md)
  * Generate and fund an EVM account for the target chain you plan to deploy your Consumer Contract to
* Deploy the Consumer Contract (The right side of the diagram above) on an EVM chain that will connect to the deployed Phat Contract
* (Optional) Create API Key from The Graph. See how to get an API Key [here](https://bit.ly/the-graph-api-key). By default a rate-limited key is provided with no guarantee of service if limit is exhausted.

## Features and Benefits

With the ability to bring The Graph data on-chain with customized logic performed on the data, this template enables developers to securely connect your indexed data to your web3 dApps. There are many features and benefits that can be built. For example:

* On-chain Trust Score
* Spam Filters
* Copy Trading
* Dynamic NFTs w/ On-chain Indexed Data
* Conditional Transactions, etc.
