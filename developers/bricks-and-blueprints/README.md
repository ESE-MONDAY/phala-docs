# Phat Bricks

## Phat Contractâ€™s No-Code Experience

Phat Bricks are prefabricated, audited Phat Contracts that perform common functions. These Bricks can be bundled together to form a Blueprint, a predefined one-click deployable solution to a common industry problem.

Developers can deploy Blueprints and integrate them with their Smart Contracts in minutes, bringing complex functionality to dApps without needing to write a single line of code.

You can check out all available Blueprints on the [app](https://bricks.phala.network/) or in the [Featured Blueprints](featured-blueprints/) section. Currently, all Bricks and Blueprints are created by the Phala Team. We plan to add features allowing users to create their own Blueprints in the near future.&#x20;
