# Introduction

PHA is the native token of the Phala blockchain. It serves several key functions and holders can use the token in a few different ways:

* Workers, the compute providers for Phala Network, receive rewards denominated in PHA. Read about how [rewards are calculated](../compute-providers/basic-info/worker-rewards.md) or [becoming a Worker](../compute-providers/run-workers-on-phala/).&#x20;
* Running programs, or [Phat Contracts](../developers/phat-contract/), on Phala Network requires users to stake PHA to their contracts. Explore the stake-to-compute model [here](../developers/phat-contract/pay-for-cloud-service.md).&#x20;
* Phala Network is a DAO governed by PHA token holders. Read about Phala's Governance mechanism [here](governance/).&#x20;
* PHA token can be staked or delegated to stakers to support the security of the network and earn rewards. Read about [delegation](delegation/) or get started on the [app](https://app.phala.network/).&#x20;
