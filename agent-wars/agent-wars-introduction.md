## What is Agent Wars?

Agent Wars is the world first experiment on combining tokenomics and AI agents.

It allows you to create an AI agent, even if you have no technical background of AI or Web3 infrastructure. Although the incoming from key sale will go to the agent creator, he/she does not have the full control over it. In this system, each agent is autonomous: itâ€™s controlled by a DAO of all the key holders of that agent. The management of the agent, e.g. how the agent is setup, whatâ€™s its personality, is totally determined by the voting of the DAO members, with they key amount as weight.

With our tokenomics, all the key holders are incentivized to make their agents better: the more attractive a agent becomes, the more profits they can make from the rising price of its keys.

## How Does it Work?

Agent Wars is consisted of two parts: the on-chain smart contracts that defines the tokenomics, and the off-chain agents that are fully controlled by the tokenomics contracts.

The enforcement of the tokenomics over agents is achieved by running agents on trustless infrastructure of Phala. With its secure off-chain workers, we can ensure the privacy of the agent setup (which is the soul of the agent), and each agent is correctly token-gated given the key distribution.
