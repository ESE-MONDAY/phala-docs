# ✅ Multi-Proof and Verifiable Compute

## Introduction

ZK is the pronoun of verifiable computing of today’s Web3, however, everyone should admit that Zero Knowledge is still early even the innovation happens extremely fast every day, and the performance issue will exist in the visible future. But we don’t limit ourselves to Zero Knowledge and use single proof in our design, other technologies like TEE, FHE, and MPC also should be considered. The following sections introduce the multi-proof system built on top of the Phala blockchain. By having this guide, we aim to elaborate on the necessity of multi-proof in the blockchain industry, and how we build it for developers to easily integrate TEE execution proof into their application.

1. As a background requirement, we suggest everyone start with **The Need for Multi-Proof Systems** section.
2. If you are a developer and hope to quickly go through how to build with our multi-proof system, you can jump to the **How to Build with Multi-Proof** section.
3. If you are doing research, and hope to get a deep understanding of the TEE and verifiable computing implemented with the Phala network, the **Trusted Execution Environments (TEE) and Compute Verifiability** section is for you.
