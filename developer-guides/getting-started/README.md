## AI-Agent Contract Overview

The following guides will dive into building an AI-Agent Contract and hosting the agent on Phala Network as a serverless backend.

The steps are simple:

* Build your AI-Agent Contract with the Phala CLI Tool ([@phala/fn](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@phala/fn))
* Upload to IPFS via ([ThirdWeb](https://portal.thirdweb.com/infrastructure/storage/overview))
* Store secrets in a vault connected to your CID
* Serve through Phala Gateway https://frames.phatfn.xyz/ipfs/\<cid>

These templates are MINIMAL. During our initial release, build with the mindset of "Less is More".
