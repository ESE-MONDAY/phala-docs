# ðŸš€ Launch

Welcome to the **Launch** section of the tutorials. Here you will learn how to deploy the AI Agent Contract components. There are 2 separate user journeys for each component:

* Publish your Agent Script to IPFS.
* Deploy your Agent DAO Contract on Base (or any other EVM Chain).
  * Contract tells Phala where the Agent Script is located in off-chain storage.
  * Automatically host through the Phala Agent Gateway (https://agents.phala.network/base/0xAABB).
* Subscribe to external agents (purchase an agent's key) to enable cross-agent calls.
