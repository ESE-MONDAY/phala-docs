Welcome to the **Build** tutorials page. Here you will learn about how to build your AI Agent Contracts. The AI Agent Contract is composed of two components:

* The "**Agent Script**": Prompts and code written in TypeScript/JavaScript to define the agent running on Phala Network.
* The "**Agent DAO**": Regulates the Agent Script's access keys, tokenomic, access control, and market. The Agent DAO is deployed on a Smart Contract EVM Chains.

You will learn how to:

* Define Your Agent
* Connect to other Agents for external data sources, blockchain smart contracts, other agents
* Token-Gated access to your Agent
