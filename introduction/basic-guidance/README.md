# Basic Guidance

## Use Browser Extension Wallet

The browser extension is a UI wallet that allows the usage of decentralized applications (dApps) in the Polkadot ecosystem through your browser. In addition, it allows you to sign transactions (verifying your on-chain identity) with your accounts easily and is needed to use Phalaâ€™s dApps.

For all Phala dApps, three wallets are currently supported, namely polkadot{.js} extension, Talisman Wallet, and SubWallet. You can use any one of them. The introduction and tutorial links of these three wallets are given below.
