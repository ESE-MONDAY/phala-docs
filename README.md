# ü§î What is Phala Network?

## Our Mission <a href="#phala-network-web3-computing-cloud" id="phala-network-web3-computing-cloud"></a>

Phala Network is revolutionizing Web3 by providing dApp developers with an off-chain compute infrastructure that is truly decentralized and trustless. By connecting Smart Contracts to our off-chain programs called [Phat Contracts](developers/phat-contract/), developers can supercharge their dApps with seamless cross-chain integrations, connectivity to the internet, and heavy computation. Phat Contracts make your Smart Contracts even smarter, and can be integrated in minutes using our no-code developer experience [Phat Bricks](developers/bricks-and-blueprints/).

Web3 developers are constantly pushing up against the technical limitations of building on-chain. Modern dApps need more than just Smart Contracts to support rich feature sets, and as Web3 has evolved and matured, it has become clear that efficient off-chain computation will be vital for a number of standard dApp use cases. Phala gives dApp developers access to powerful off-chain services without compromising the principles of Web3. **This is Computation as it‚Äôs Meant to Be.**

Furthermore, in a digital landscape that is becoming increasingly centralized, Phala Network seeks to go against the grain by building a compute network that anybody can provide for or build on top of, trustlessly. In other words, Phala is a **Public Good Network**.

## Trustless Computation. Verifiable Results.

Phala Network is designed with multiple layers of security guarantees to provide fully verifiable computation. Anybody with the correct hardware can become a compute providing ‚Äú[Worker](broken-reference/)‚Äù for the network and earn rewards, and Phala has an array of mechanisms in place to ensure Workers always carry out computation faithfully and securely. [Tokenomic incentives](developers/phat-contract/pay-for-cloud-service.md), hardware-based assurances, and cryptographic evidence of execution published and verified on the Phala blockchain enable Phat Contract to seamlessly extend blockchain-level security to the off-chain realm.

## Supercharge Your dApps with Phat Contract

Developers can use Phala Network by deploying Phat Contracts, programs that run on Phala Network‚Äôs off-chain Workers that can interface with Smart Contracts on any chain.

Our low-code experience, Phat Contract 2.0, uses pre-written, audited Phat Contracts to form complex functions using TypeScript/JavaScript that developers can integrate with their Smart Contracts in minutes.

Developers with experience using Rust, ink!, JavaScript, or TypeScript can jump into [Phat Contract Rust SDK](developers/getting-started/) and write their own custom programs to service any number of use cases.

Use cases for Phat Contract include:

* Connect your Smart Contract to any API
* Interface with any S3 storage platform
* Compute over data
* Automate Smart Contracts
* etc.

You can read more about Phat Contract [use cases](developers/phat-contract/use-cases.md) here.

## Join the People‚Äôs Network and Earn Rewards

If you want to help power the decentralized internet, you can become a compute-providing Worker for Phala network and earn rewards by allowing Web3 applications to run programs on your hardware.
