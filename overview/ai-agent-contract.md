### AI Agent Contract

AI Agent Contract allows you to build your smart contract centric AI Agents in three steps:

1. **Agentize smart contracts**: Create smart contract centric AI Agents for popular web3 services and smart contracts. "**Regulate**" your AI Agents through a DAO to enforce business logic for your agents.
2. **Connect to the internet of multi-agents**: Make your agents accessible by other cross-platform AI Agents deployed on Autonolas, FLock.io, Morpheus, Polywrap, etc.
3. **Launch and get incentivized**: Own your agents and build a profitable tokenomic through our default tokenomic model or customize your own.
