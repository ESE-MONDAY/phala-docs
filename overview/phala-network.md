# ⚖️ Phala Network

Phala Network is the Execution Layer for Web3 AI. By enabling AI to understand and interact with blockchains, it unlocks the barrier for the first billion users to join web3.

### The Missing AI Execution Layer

Web3 is complex. You often need to use multiple wallets across a few blockchains and dapps to complete a basic task. For example, buying a NFT may involve swapping, bridging, and purchasing. This complexity is the biggest barrier of mass adoption.

AI can greatly improve the web3 user experience. Imagine that AI can do its own research, and go one step further to delegate every operation for you. You can simply give instructions and wait them to be done. This is where AI Agent projects like Autonolas, Polywrap, fetch.ai (and more) can help.

However, none of the existing AI Agents is smart contract centric. They cannot execute smart contract operations securely and autonomously, due to its off-chain nature. The missing AI Execution Layer Agents is preventing developers from creating smart contracts centric AI Agents.

### Our Solution

Phala Network's multi-proof system is the answer to the AI execution problem. On top of the Phala Network, you can easily build tamper-proof and unstoppable AI Agents that closely integrated with on-chain smart contracts.

Phala offers the full toolkits to help you build, ship, and profit from your smart contract centric AI Agents.

#### AI Agent Contract

AI Agent Contract allows you to build your smart contract centric AI Agents in three steps:

1. **Agentize smart contracts**: Create a way to "**regulate**" your AI Agents for smart contracts with natural and programming languages
2. **Connect to the internet of multi-agents**: Make your agents accessible by other cross-chain AI Agents
3. **Launch and get incentivized**: Own your agents and build a profitable tokenomic.
