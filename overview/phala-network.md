# ⚖️ Phala Network

Phala Network is the Execution Layer for Web3 AI. By enabling AI to understand and interact with blockchains, it unlocks the barrier for the first billion users to join web3.

### The Missing AI Execution Layer

Confidential AI Inference stands as a cornerstone for safeguarding sensitive data and ensuring secure AI model execution in Web3. Through the implementation of LLM models within Trusted Execution Environments (TEE), Phala Network delivers private and verifiable AI computations. This robust approach addresses fundamental challenges in the Web3 ecosystem: data privacy protection, secure execution guarantees, and computational verifiability. Such capabilities are essential for applications where the protection of user data and model integrity is paramount.

AI has the potential to revolutionize the Web3 user experience by acting as an autonomous agent. Imagine AI systems that can not only conduct research independently but also execute operations on your behalf – you simply provide instructions and watch as tasks are completed. While projects like Autonolas, Polywrap, and fetch.ai are pioneering this space, they face a crucial limitation: none are truly smart contract-centric. Their off-chain nature prevents them from executing smart contract operations securely and autonomously. This gap in AI Execution Layer Agents creates a barrier for developers seeking to build smart contract-centric AI Agents.
